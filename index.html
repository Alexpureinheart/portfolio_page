        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I’m Alexander Watts-Barnett, but most people call me Alex. I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada but 
            currently reside in South Korea where I have been living and working since 2016. 
            In 2019 I began my journey as a developer in earnest and have never looked back. 

            I believe that, to be a truly great developer it’s important to cultivate a strong foundation in computer 
            science fundamentals so that one can confidently and quickly learn to use new tools as they evolve in this 
            exciting and ever-changing industry.   
            
            When I’m not writing programs, developing websites and software or up-skilling, I’m usually reading, 
            studying and/or teaching languages (natural languages that is) and going on excursions with my wife and daughter. 
            Video games and exercise are also things I like to do when time affords, and I’m a huge fan of the Arts 
            - virtually all of them - and I’m quite a foodie as well. I also write.
